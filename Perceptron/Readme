# Perceptron Logic Gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, NOT, XOR)

This repo shows what a **perceptron** is by building classic **logic gates** with it.

You’ll implement a single perceptron (a simple binary classifier) and use it to reproduce the truth tables for:

- AND
- OR
- NAND
- NOR
- NOT
- XOR (needs multiple perceptrons)

It also includes a test file that verifies every gate automatically.

## What is a perceptron?

A perceptron is the simplest “neural network unit”. It takes inputs, computes a weighted sum, adds a bias, then produces a binary decision.

### Step 1: Weighted sum

\[
z = w \cdot x + b
\]

- `x` = input vector (e.g. `[0, 1]`)
- `w` = weight vector (importance of each input)
- `b` = bias (shifts the decision boundary)

### Step 2: Step activation

\[
output =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } z \ge 0 \\
0 & \text{if } z < 0
\end{cases}
\]

This makes the perceptron a **linear classifier**: it separates the input space with a straight line (in 2D).

## What we are doing in this project

### 1) Implement the perceptron

`perceptron.py` contains:
- `step(z)` activation function
- `perceptron(x, w, b)` prediction function

### 2) Hardcode weights for logic gates

Logic gates are perfect for learning perceptrons because inputs and outputs are binary and easy to verify.

Examples:
- AND outputs 1 only for `[1, 1]`
- OR outputs 1 if any input is 1
- NAND is the inverse of AND
- NOR is the inverse of OR
- NOT uses a single input

### 3) XOR needs more than one perceptron

XOR is not linearly separable, so a single perceptron can’t do it.

We implement XOR using a **2-layer composition**:

\[
XOR(x,y) = AND(OR(x,y), NAND(x,y))
\]

That’s the simplest demonstration of why multi-layer networks exist.

### 4) Test everything automatically

`test_logic_gates.py` imports `perceptron.py` and checks that every gate matches its truth table using assertions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ recommended
- NumPy

Install:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
## How to run the tests

From the project folder:
```bash
python test_logic_gates.py
```

If everything is correct, you should see:
```bash
All perceptron gate tests passed
```
## Issue Faced: NAND failing for [1, 1]

If you see:

```bash
AssertionError: NAND failed for [1, 1]
```

Check your step function.

It must be:

```bash
def step(z):
    return 1 if z >= 0 else 0
```

If you use z > 0 instead of z >= 0, some gates can break due to threshold edge cases.

You can also give yourself a bit more margin by using biases like 1.6 instead of 1.5 for NAND if needed.
